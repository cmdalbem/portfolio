## Overview

bike de boa is an open and collaborative map of places to park your bike. It's focused on being super easy to use and also educative. With the app you can search for bike parkings nearby, and at the same time you learn if they are safe to use and why they are so.

We believe that the bicycle is the future of urban mobility, and that having better bike parkings is a great way of promoting the bike culture in our cities. This project intends to push forward the discussion of what are good bike parkings, at the same time we collect data about the presence and evolution of this kind of structure in the cities of Brazil.

This project is a (Progressive) Web App, which means it loads and runs fast accross all platforms and device sizes, as well as is fully indexable by search engines.

## Who we are

BIKE DE BOA ("bike ‘n’ chill") is collaborative website and app where people map and review places to park their bikes. These places, fundamental for the intermodal integration, can either be proper bike racks or any other urban objects used with that goal. The collaborative aspect allows the active participation of citizens, fostering a positive reinforcement that encourages more people commute with their bikes. On top of that the reviews and our bike parking guide bring information about best practices in a friendly way that educates about safety and encourages better structures to be installed.

Our app was designed with simplicity and usability in mind, and engineered to be lightweight and compatible with all devices, making this platform extremely accessible and inclusive. It’s also completely open: all our source code and data is open to be reused and to receive contributions.

We are a non-profit collective of friends and bikers with diverse backgrounds but with the common goal of contributing to the bike culture in Brazil.
 

## Process

I wanted to contribute in some way to foster the local culture of urban biking. Analysing the many problems people face when commuting with bicycles I identified a big one that I felt could be addressed in an efficient and innovative way using technology: where to park my bike safely?

Many places already offered good structures to their clients to park their bikes, but people didn’t seem to know about them. Also there are big misconceptions on what it means to safely park a bike, so there was a big opportunity to reach people and educate them.

Our solution is an online, collaborative platform where people can map and review places to park your bike. Although the idea is simple, we’ve put lots of effort in the small details. It was important to be super easy to use to be as democratic as possible. It was also important to be a pleasant experience in overall because we're trying to educate and create new habits. Our main objects was to compel people to explore the map and the to know better their cities, as well as to contribute and express their opinion on what is available.

We back all our decisions with user interviews and extensive research for content on bike safety and urban guidelines from around the world. I started getting really active on online biking communities to reach all kinds of opinions. With that we designed a system that gives a voice for people to say how safe they feel at places and also educates them with good practices from experts.

We use web technology because it’s the most democratic platform ever. We’ve been using modern tools and concepts like Progressive Web Apps to offer great experiences from low-end to high-end Mobile and Desktop devices while still being free of friction.
 
I’ve been the main responsible for the development and the Visual and UX Design. This has been a great project to put in practice lots of concepts and ideas from my studies with User Experience. I’ve also grown to be an analytics-freak, relentlessly playing with tools, metrics and reports to understand every little microinteraction from every user. In just 6 months the web app has already been accessed by more than 1300 people and the bike parkings got more than 9000 views, even with small efforts on the marketing side and almost no media coverage.
