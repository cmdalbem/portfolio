Final project for the course on Advanced Human Computer Interaction.

What if we could plot a guitar song in one single image? And what if it could at the same time be beautiful and generate interesting insights about the performer's style?

Made with web technology, including the D3.js dataviz library, and some basic music theory.

##Further work

- Extend the concept to other instruments
- Study the most common sequences of notes used
- Add support for Chords
- Apply machine learning techniques to identify prominent paths
- Experiment with colours to put more visual information
- Dynamically select the part of song to be visualized 
- Add support for special notes like bends, tremolos, open strings, etc.
