description: "My first incursion with digital art, and probably the birth of my aesthetic self. Making space wallpapers got me started with digital design tools like Photoshop and 3D modeling software and also with a vibrant community of online artists and designers."

I was an active member of DeviantArt, one of the biggest online communities for digital artists. There I learned and taught from digital art creation to digital design tools and the basics of visual experssion. I used to heavily interact with artists from all around the world, exchanging feedback and knowledge. It proved to be a great way to become better and better.

I value a lot this experience for I see it as the building blocks of my career as a creative and creator of stuff.

Although it was not the objective, my intense contributions over the years paid off as having a decently popular gallery among those "space artists" with more than 32,000 pageviews. I even got a compliment of Greg Martin, a legend of this field, which totally freaked me out at the time haha
