title: "Meu Corre"
minibio: "Building a personal financial management app for delivery workers in Brazil."
description: "For 2 years we've been researching about the conditions of delivery workers in Brazil and we've learned that, while they suffer of bad working conditions, the society lacks reliable data about their reality. We've developed a financial organization app focused on delivery workers to help them be more conscious of their financial condition. At the same time, it'll generate valuable data for academic research which, ultimately, will contribute for better public policies."
