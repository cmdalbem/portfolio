                  <p>
                    I'm a designer with a skill set ranging from researching to designing and programming products and systems. I'm interested in solving problems related to the human experience of technology and tools we use to work and express ourselves.

                    My background in Computer Science has biased me towards solutions that are scalable, maintainable and that stand the test of time. This mindset also applies to businesses and their role in the society. I work with purpose, and I like creating stuff that contribute to a more sustainable and equitable world.

                  <p>
                    I'm very curious and I'm always learning different stuff. I find it helps me stay creative, and give me knowledge to find the right problems to solve, as well as the right solutions for them.
