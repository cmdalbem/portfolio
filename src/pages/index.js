              <p>
                I'm a Designer focused in solving problems that are somewhere in the
                middle between people and their tools, with a skillset that ranges
                from researching to designing and programming products and systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Iâ€™m curious about everything related to the human experience and our
                relation with technology. And I'm always learning, because to solve
                the right problems the right way demands a set of skills that goes
                beyond just digital tools.
              </p>
              <p>
                My background in Computer Science has biased me to design solutions
                that are scalable, maintainable and that stand the test of time. And
                I tend to extend this mindset to businesses and their role in the
                world, and I'm interested in creating stuff that contribute to a
                more sustainable and equitable world.
