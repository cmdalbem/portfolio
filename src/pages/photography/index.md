Since 2007 Iâ€™ve been managing a digital portfolio of digital and analogic photography that has been viewed more than 250,000 times on Flickr.

Photography has been for many years the main way in which I try to express my views, always trying to see the world from different perspectives and looking for beauty in the most ordinary places. 

I love all aspects of the photographic process. From connecting with moments and capturing it with sensibility and precision. To spending hours perfecting the post-production and curating a collection. To live in a constant search for the perfect match between technical quality and meaningful content.

Below is a small collection of some of the pictures I hold nearest to my heart. For more stuff like this feel free to check my [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/helloninja) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/cmdalbem).
