title: "Nubank's CX Platform"
minibio: "Designing a new version to improve the productivity and quality of the company's award-winning customer support."
description: "Shuffle, Nubank's internal CX platform, started in 2014 as a simple CRM tool to show customer information to the agent who was serving a customer. Years later it grew to be much more than that, centralizing all support channels (chat, email and telephone) and dozens of different backoffice jobs. This project aimed to understand better the users and stakeholders expectations of what a new version of this tool could look like. I identified, prototyped and tested solutions to the main painpoints while taking into account strategic drivers to make sure the product was built to scale with the business."
